/**
 * Endofunctor in programming is the same as Functor
 *
 * Functor that maps a category back to that same category is called an endofunctor.
 * Quick detour from the category theory into the real world â€” in programming,
 * we deal with functors in category of types, and they are all endofunctors.
 * They map a category of types back to category of types.
 * Whenever you mapped something (map in Scala, fmap in Haskell) you had an endofunctor in your hands.
 * For example, Option, List and Future are all valid endofunctors. Basically anything that has a map() function is an endofunctor.
